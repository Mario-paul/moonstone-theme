Select the theme as your Desktop in the Cinnamon Themes app.

## Other info
This theme is based on Mint-Y-Dark, which itself is based on horst3180's Arc theme, and uses the same GUI colors as the former. However, most desktop elements have been given transparency, carefully adjusted so they are not only pleasing to look at, but also usable (ie. not so transparent that it's difficult to read text). Some of these elements are the desktop panel, menu, OSD, window switcher list (alt + tab), grouped window list thumbnail, as well as run dialog box.

gtk3 elements (like program windows) and metacity elements (program title bars) have not been modified. I would love to modify them, but there is the issue of usability in case you have many windows open and overlaid over each other so they probably better left untouched.
